# SpaceStation: Stellar Horizons ðŸš€

## Overview
**SpaceStation: Stellar Horizons** is a console-based Java application that simulates interplanetary travel. It allows users to explore planets, learn about the features of different rockets, and embark on virtual space journeys. This project demonstrates structured programming, arrays, and console-based interaction in Java.

## Usage
1. **Run the program using the instructions above**
   
2. **Follow the on-screen prompts to"
   - Learn about planets
   - Explore available rockets
   - Simulate a space journey

3. Use numeric inputs to select menu options

## Future enhancements
1. **Add random events**:
   - Store random event data similarly to rocket and planet data.
   - Use regular arrays to store event descriptions, survival probability, tasks, number of attempts, and the chance of success per event with `Random.nextInt(10)`.
   - Base success on individual probability, contrasting the result with a range number between 1 and some other number depending on the chance of success.
2. ** Add ASCII art in case of random event resolution failure to represent the death of the tribulation.
